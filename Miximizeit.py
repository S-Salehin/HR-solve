# To solve this problem in Python, you can use the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of selecting one element from each list. Then, for each combination, calculate the sum of the squares of the selected elements modulo `M` and track the maximum value obtained.

# Here's how you can implement it:

# ```python
import itertools

def maximize(K, M, lists):
    # Initialize the maximum value to 0
    max_value = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible combinations using itertools.product
    for combination in itertools.product(*lists):
        # Calculate the sum of squares of the combination modulo M
        current_value = sum(x**2 for x in combination) % M
        
        # Update the maximum value
        max_value = max(max_value, current_value)
    
    return max_value

# Reading input
K, M = map(int, input().split())
lists = []
for _ in range(K):
    # Appending the list, ignoring the first element which is the size of the list
    lists.append(list(map(int, input().split()))[1:])

# Call the maximize function and print the result
result = maximize(K, M, lists)
print(result)
# ```

# ### Explanation:

# 1. **Reading Input:**
#    - First, we read the values of `K` and `M`.
#    - Then, for each of the `K` lists, we read the integers and store them, ignoring the first integer of each line which indicates the size of the list.

# 2. **Generating Combinations:**
#    - `itertools.product(*lists)` generates all possible combinations by picking one element from each list.

# 3. **Calculating the Maximum Value:**
#    - For each combination, calculate the sum of the squares of the elements and apply the modulo `M`.
#    - Track the maximum value of this calculation.

# 4. **Output:**
#    - Finally, the maximum possible value is printed.

# ### Example:
# For the given sample input:

# ```
# 3 1000
# 2 5 4
# 3 7 8 9
# 5 5 7 8 9 10
# ```

# The code will produce the output `206`, which is the correct result.

# ### Efficiency:
# The code is efficient given the constraints, as `K` and `N_i` are relatively small, allowing us to check all combinations without performance issues.

# This approach will pass all the test cases, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.
